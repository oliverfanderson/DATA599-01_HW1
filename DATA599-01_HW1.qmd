## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>% summary
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
   ggplot() + 
   aes(x=cyl) + 
   geom_bar() + 
   theme_minimal()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Oliver is typing this for the initial commit.
